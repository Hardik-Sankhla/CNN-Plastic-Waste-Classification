## Project Description  
Plastic pollution is a growing concern globally, and effective waste segregation is critical to tackling this issue. This project employs a CNN model to classify plastic waste into distinct categories, facilitating automated waste management.  

## Dataset  
The dataset comprises labeled images of various types of plastic waste. Each image corresponds to a specific plastic category, allowing for precise classification.  

*Note: Ensure appropriate dataset licensing and usage guidelines are followed.*  

## Model Architecture  
The CNN architecture includes:  
- **Convolutional Layers:** Feature extraction  
- **Pooling Layers:** Dimensionality reduction  
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Classification  
- **Activation Functions:** ReLU and Softmax  

### Basic CNN Architecture

</p>

## Training  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Epochs:** Configurable (default: 25)  
- **Batch Size:** Configurable (default: 32)  

Data augmentation techniques were utilized to enhance model performance and generalizability.  

## Weekly Progress
